# Medium Clone Desktop View

A responsive Medium-like desktop application clone built with React and styled-components, featuring a dynamic header, sidebar, and modals for user interaction.

## Description

This project is a desktop view clone of Medium, a popular blogging platform. It replicates the interface and user interactions such as a responsive sidebar, dynamic header with hamburger, search, write, notification, and profile modals. The application is built using React for component-based architecture, and styled-components for modular CSS styling. The purpose is to provide a fully interactive user interface for reading and writing articles, browsing staff picks, recommended topics, and managing notifications and user profile settings.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Node.js >= 18.x
- npm >= 9.x
- Windows 10 / macOS / Linux
- React 18.x
- styled-components 5.x
- Vite 5.x

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-folder>


Install dependencies:

npm install


No modifications are needed for files or folder structure; ensure the src folder remains intact with components, App.jsx, and main.jsx.

Executing Program

To start the development server:

npm run dev


Open the application in your browser at the URL provided in the console, usually http://localhost:5173.

To build the production version:

npm run build

Help

If modals or components do not render, check that all imports are correctly spelled and match the folder structure (e.g., modal vs modals).

If styled-components fail, ensure Node.js and npm versions meet the prerequisites.

npm install


Common troubleshooting: Delete node_modules and package-lock.json then run npm install again.
